#### Objective:

- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
- Build a clustering model to segment the customer-based similarity.
- Build k-means clustering method in python to identify clusters of customers better in this dataset.


### The Following skills concepts demonstrated:

- Data cleaning and preparation.
- Data analysis and exploration.
- Statistical analysis.
- Creating data visualizations.
- Creating K-means algorithm _Machine Learning Model In Python_ for dividing the dataset points into distinct clusters.

  ### Cconclusion:
  1- Cluster 1 customers shopped recently, with high frequency and monetary,
  this means that these are the loyal customers that we want to keep.

  2 - Cluster 3 has landed in the mid range for all three features, these might be our regular customer,
  that can be encouraged to be 
  more engaged. And maybe there are things we can improve for them
